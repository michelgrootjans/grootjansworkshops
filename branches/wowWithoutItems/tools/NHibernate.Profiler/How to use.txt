Preparing an application to be profiled
==================================
Add a reference to HibernatingRhinos.NHibernate.Profiler.Appender.dll assembly (located in the downloadable zip).
In the application startup (Application_Start in web applications, Program.Main in windows / console applications or the App constructor for WPF applications), make the following call:
HibernatingRhinos.NHibernate.Profiler.Appender.NHibernateProfiler.Initialize();


Profiling the application
=====================
Open the HibernatingRhinos.NHibernate.Profiler.Client.exe
Start using the application.
You should see the results immediately in the UI.
